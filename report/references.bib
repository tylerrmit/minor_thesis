	abstract = { Bicycles offer a promising transportation alternative to private motor vehicles, especially in areas with congestion, poor air quality, and high fuel prices. The study on which this paper is based sought rational methods for determining the most efficient use of the available funds to improve bicycle transportation. A bicycle network analysis tool was developed to assess the networkwide level of service offered to bicyclists in a study area. The tool uses route length and measures of perceived safety to quantify the bicycle friendliness of a street network. The tool can be used to compare networks and assist with the selection of locations for bicycle facility improvements. },

This study surveyed cyclists about a multi-section route --- actually riding the route --- and asked then to rate the safety of each section.  It then had them watch video of rides through other routes and rate them.

It created a regression model to predict the cyclists' safety rating, with the coefficients determining how much significance was attached to various attributes.},

@article{CAMPBELL2019101350,
	abstract = {Street traffic sign infrastructure remains an extremely difficult asset for local government to manage due to its diverse physical structure and geographical distribution. A spatial registrar of traffic infrastructure is currently a required component of local government councils' mandatory road management plans. Recent advancements of object detection technology in machine learning have presented an automated approach for the detection and classification of street signage captured by Google's Street View (GSV) imagery. This paper explores the possibility of using deep learning to produce an autonomous system for detecting traffic signs on GSV images to assist in traffic assets monitoring and maintenance. By leveraging Google's Street View API, this research offers an economic approach of building purposeful street sign computer vision datasets. A custom object detection model was trained to detect and classify Stop and Give Way signs from images captured at intersection approaches. Considering the output detected bounding box coordinates, photogrammetry approach was applied to calculate the approximate location of each detected sign in two-dimensional geographical space. The newly located and classified street signs can be combined with relevant spatial data for implementation into an asset management system. By combining GIS and the GSV API, the process is completely scalable to any level of street sign classification scope. The experiments conducted on the road network of study area recorded a detection accuracy of 95.63% and classification accuracy of 97.82%. Our proposed automated approach to the detection and localisation of street sign infrastructure has displayed a promising potential for its use by local government authorities. Our workflow can be used to detect other traffic signs and applied to other road sections and other cities. Of primary importance, this approach takes an entirely free and open-source approach throughout. The continuation of Google's Street View program will account for the spatiotemporal representation of street sign infrastructure for the ongoing maintenance and renewal programs of this valuable asset.},
	annote = {Paper by another member of the department.

What they did is similar to part of what I need to do:
* Create a dataset of 500 images per road sign (stop, give way)
* Train a deep learning model to detect those signs in Google Street View images
* Use photogrammetry (position of bounding box + known optics and position of camera) to determine a precise location for each sign
* Compare to a ``ground truth'' database of signs in one suburb where the database was in reasonable order, and investigate differences
* Apply to another suburb where the position of signs is not already known

In this case, I'll want to detect the ``bike'' symbols on bike lanes, to distinguish bike lanes from paved shoulders etc.

I'll want to use a different model (perhaps Canny/Hough line detection in OpenCV) to detect the road lane markings, then photogrammetry to estimate the lane width.

Hopefully given they were very successful identifying the stop/give way signs, it's realistic to build an engine to find the bike lane symbols on the ground.  I'll have to build my own training dataset, but I'm sure it will be character building.},

@article{GREENERY2015,
	abstract = {We explored Google Street View (GSV) as a street-level, urban greenery assessment tool. Street-level greenery has long played a critical role in the visual quality of urban landscapes. This living landscape element can and should be assessed for the quality of visual impact with the GSV information, and the assessed street-level greenery information could be incorporated into urban landscape planning and management. Information on street-level views of urban greenery assessment, however, is rare or nonexistent. Planners and managers' ability to plan and manage urban landscapes effectively and efficiently is, therefore, limited. GSV is one tool that might provide street-level, profile views of urban landscape and greenery, yet no research on GSV for urban planning seems available in literature. We modified an existing Green View Index (GVI) formula and conducted a case study assessment of street greenery using GSV images in the area of East Village, Manhattan District, New York City. We found that GSV to be well suited for assessing street-level greenery. We suggest further that the modified GVI may be a relatively objective measurement of street-level greenery, and that GSV in combination with GVI may be well suited in guiding urban landscape planning and management.},

	abstract = { A reliable, punctual, and spatially accurate dataset of sidewalks is vital for identifying where improvements can be made upon urban environment to enhance multi-modal accessibility, social cohesion, and residents' physical activity. This paper develops a synthetically new spatial procedure to extract the sidewalk by integrating the detected results from aerial and street view imagery. We first train neural networks to extract sidewalks from aerial images, and then use pre-trained models to restore occluded and missing sidewalks from street view images. By combining the results from both data sources, a complete network of sidewalks can be produced. Our case study includes four counties in the U.S., and both precision and recall reach about 0.9. The street view imagery helps restore the occluded sidewalks and largely enhances the sidewalk network's connectivity by linking 20\% of dangles. },

First, the convolutional neural network (CNN), which is able to capture large context of local structures, are applied to predict the probability of a pixel belonging to road regions, and assign labels to each pixel to describe whether it is road. Then, a line integral convolution based algorithm is developed to smooth the rough map to connect small gaps. Finally, by combining with some common image processing operators, road centerlines are able to be acquired.

@book{SZELISKI2010,
	abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of recipes, this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses; presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects; provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory; suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book; supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/. Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.},

The advent of deep learning for object detection provides an opportunity for detecting utility poles from side-view optical images. In this study, we proposed using a deep learning-based method for automatically mapping roadside utility poles with crossarms (UPCs) from Google Street View (GSV) images. The method combines the state-of-the-art DL object detection algorithm (i.e., the RetinaNet object detection algorithm) and a modified brute-force-based line-of-bearing (LOB, a LOB stands for the ray towards the location of the target [UPC at here] from the original location of the sensor [GSV mobile platform]) measurement method to estimate the locations of detected roadside UPCs from GSV. Experimental results indicate that: (1) both the average precision (AP) and the overall accuracy (OA) are around 0.78 when the intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold is greater than 0.3, based on the testing of 500 GSV images with a total number of 937 objects; and (2) around 2.6%, 47%, and 79% of estimated locations of utility poles are within 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m buffer zones, respectively, around the referenced locations of utility poles.

A significant amount of these efforts has to go on the setup and maintenance of sidewalk inventory on a certain geographic scale (e.g., citywide, statewide). To address the stated problem, this paper proposes the development of an aerial-image-based approach that can 1) extract the features of sidewalks based on digital vehicle road network; 2) overlay the initial sidewalk features with aerial imagery and extract aerial images around the sidewalk area; 3) apply a machine learning algorithm to classify sidewalk images into two major categories, that is, concrete surface present or sidewalks missing; and 4) construct a connected sidewalk network in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. A deep convolutional neural network is applied to classify the extracted sidewalk images. The learning algorithm gives 97.22\% total predication rate for the test set and 92.6\% total predication rate in the blind test. The proposed method takes full advantage of available data sources and builds on top of the existing roadway network to digitize sidewalks. },

	abstract = { Objectives. We compared cycling injury risks of 14 route types and other route infrastructure features.Methods. We recruited 690 city residents injured while cycling in Toronto or Vancouver, Canada. A case-crossover design compared route infrastructure at each injury site to that of a randomly selected control site from the same trip.Results. Of 14 route types, cycle tracks had the lowest risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.11; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.54), about one ninth the risk of the reference: major streets with parked cars and no bike infrastructure. Risks on major streets were lower without parked cars (adjusted OR = 0.63; 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.96) and with bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.29, 1.01). Local streets also had lower risks (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95\% CI = 0.31, 0.84). Other infrastructure characteristics were associated with increased risks: streetcar or train tracks (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95\% CI = 1.8, 5.1), downhill grades (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95\% CI = 1.7, 3.1), and construction (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95\% CI = 1.3, 2.9).Conclusions. The lower risks on quiet streets and with bike-specific infrastructure along busy streets support the route-design approach used in many northern European countries. Transportation infrastructure with lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce injuries and promote cycling. },

The study area of Tyne and Wear County in the north-east of England is used as a case study. An accurate dynamic road safety model is constructed, and an understanding of the key parameters affecting the cyclist safety is developed.

Universities designated as bicycle-friendly were interviewed to examine how they addressed engineering, encouragement, education, evaluation, and enforcement for cycling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded. Universities (n = 17) ranged in size (small to large), bike-friendliness designation levels (bronze, silver, gold or platinum), and geographic location. Universities reported the following as promoting/facilitating cycling: quality bicycling infrastructure connecting campus and surrounding areas, various educational initiatives and resources, bike share accessibility, a written bike plan and regular transportation surveys, and secure bicycle storage areas and theft deterrents. The interaction between the university and community to support cycling on different levels was also noted as important. Findings provide a foundation for universities aiming to increase bike-friendliness for students and employees and inform future active commuting interventions on college campuses.},

@article{RABL2012121,
	abstract = {There is a growing awareness that significant benefits for our health and environment could be achieved by reducing our use of cars and shifting instead to active transport, i.e. walking and bicycling. The present article presents an estimate of the health impacts due to a shift from car to bicycling or walking, by evaluating four effects: the change in exposure to ambient air pollution for the individuals who change their transportation mode, their health benefit, the health benefit for the general population due to reduced pollution and the risk of accidents. We consider only mortality in detail, but at the end of the paper we also cite costs for other impacts, especially noise and congestion. For the dispersion of air pollution from cars we use results of the Transport phase of the ExternE project series and derive general results that can be applied in different regions. We calculate the health benefits of bicycling and walking based on the most recent review by the World Health Organization. For a driver who switches to bicycling for a commute of 5km (one way) 5 days/week 46 weeks/yr the health benefit from the physical activity is worth about 1300€/yr, and in a large city (>500,000) the value of the associated reduction of air pollution is on the order of 30€/yr. For the individual who makes the switch, the change in air pollution exposure and dose implies a loss of about 20€/yr under our standard scenario but that is highly variable with details of the trajectories and could even have the opposite sign. The results for walking are similar. The increased accident risk for bicyclists is extremely dependent on the local context; data for Paris and Amsterdam imply that the loss due to fatal accidents is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the health benefit of the physical activity. An analysis of the uncertainties shows that the general conclusion about the order of magnitude of these effects is robust. The results can be used for cost-benefit analysis of programs or projects to increase active transport, provided one can estimate the number of individuals who make a mode shift.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Physical inactivity is a global pandemic responsible for over 5 million deaths annually through its effects on multiple non-communicable diseases. We aimed to document how objectively measured attributes of the urban environment are related to objectively measured physical activity, in an international sample of adults.
Methods
We based our analyses on the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) adult study, which was a coordinated, international, cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled from neighbourhoods with varied levels of walkability and socioeconomic status. The present analyses of data from the IPEN adult study included 6822 adults aged 18--66 years from 14 cities in ten countries on five continents. Indicators of walkability, public transport access, and park access were assessed in 1·0 km and 0·5 km street network buffers around each participant's residential address with geographic information systems. Mean daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity were measured with 4--7 days of accelerometer monitoring. Associations between environmental attributes and physical activity were estimated using generalised additive mixed models with gamma variance and logarithmic link functions.
Results
Four of six environmental attributes were significantly, positively, and linearly related to physical activity in the single variable models: net residential density (exp[b] 1·006 [95% CI 1·003--1·009]; p=0·001), intersection density (1·069 [1·011--1·130]; p=0·019), public transport density (1·037 [1·018--1·056]; p=0·0007), and number of parks (1·146 [1·033--1·272]; p=0·010). Mixed land use and distance to nearest public transport point were not related to physical activity. The difference in physical activity between participants living in the most and least activity-friendly neighbourhoods ranged from 68 min/week to 89 min/week, which represents 45--59% of the 150 min/week recommended by guidelines.
Interpretation
Design of urban environments has the potential to contribute substantially to physical activity. Similarity of findings across cities suggests the promise of engaging urban planning, transportation, and parks sectors in efforts to reduce the health burden of the global physical inactivity pandemic.
Funding
Funding for coordination of the IPEN adult study, including the present analysis, was provided by the National Cancer Institute of National Institutes of Health (CA127296) with studies in each country funded by different sources.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including major non-communicable diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and shortens life expectancy. Because much of the world's population is inactive, this link presents a major public health issue. We aimed to quantify the effect of physical inactivity on these major non-communicable diseases by estimating how much disease could be averted if inactive people were to become active and to estimate gain in life expectancy at the population level.
Methods
For our analysis of burden of disease, we calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) associated with physical inactivity using conservative assumptions for each of the major non-communicable diseases, by country, to estimate how much disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated. We used life-table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.
Findings
Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity causes 6% (ranging from 3·2% in southeast Asia to 7·8% in the eastern Mediterranean region) of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% (3·9--9·6) of type 2 diabetes, 10% (5·6--14·1) of breast cancer, and 10% (5·7--13·8) of colon cancer. Inactivity causes 9% (range 5·1--12·5) of premature mortality, or more than 5·3 million of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, but decreased instead by 10% or 25%, more than 533 000 and more than 1·3 million deaths, respectively, could be averted every year. We estimated that elimination of physical inactivity would increase the life expectancy of the world's population by 0·68 (range 0·41--0·95) years.
Interpretation
Physical inactivity has a major health effect worldwide. Decrease in or removal of this unhealthy behaviour could improve health substantially.

	abstract = {Objective
Guidelines for bicycle infrastructure design tend to consider safety issues but not wider health issues. This paper explores the overall health impact of bicycle infrastructure provision, including not just road safety impacts, but also the population health impacts stemming from physical activity as well as cyclists׳ exposure to air pollution.
Data and methods
We have summarised key publications on how bicycle paths and lanes affect cyclists׳ exposure to physical activity, air pollution, and road safety. The health impact is modelled using all-cause mortality as a metric for a scenario with new bicycle lanes and paths in a hypothetical city.
Results
The outcomes of the study suggest that, based on currently available research, a reduction of all-cause mortality is to be expected from building bicycle lanes and paths along busy roads with mixed traffic. Increased physical activity through more time spent cycling is the major contribution, but is also the most uncertain aspect. Effects related to air pollution and cycling safety are likely to reduce mortality but are small. The overall benefits are large enough to achieve a high benefit-cost ratio for bicycle infrastructure.
Conclusions
The introduction of bicycle paths and lanes is likely to be associated with health benefits, primarily due to increased physical activity. More research is needed to estimate the absolute size of the health benefits. In particular, evaluations of the effects of bicycle infrastructure on time spent cycling are limited or of insufficient quality to infer causality. We recommend before-after studies measuring the effects of different interventions and in areas representing a wide range of base levels of cycling participation.},

It doesn't really find a ``lane''

But perhaps if I can find the road with one method, and find the white markings with another method, I can take the difference to get the width of the left-most lane.  Is THAT the bike lane?  Or is it parallel parking?

So to measure lanes, I might find myself starting with this to identify the boundary of the road, then using Canny/Hough techniques to identify the lanes},

	abstract = {In order to improve the accuracy of detecting lane for automatic vehicle driving, a method for detecting the straight part of Lane is proposed, which is the Multi-Scale Hough transform method for lane detection based on the algorithm of Otsu and Canny. First of all, by the methods of Otsu to segment image and use the morphology operation of erode and dilate to wipe off the information of roadside trees and fences to strengthen the road boundary characteristics.Then the lane edge and feature is gained by the canny operator. At last, using Standard Hough Transform, Progressiveness Probabilities Hough Transform and Multi-Scale Hough Transform complete the detection of lane's straight part. The experimental results show that, Multi-Scale Hough Transform method can accurately detect the lane line and provide the reliable basis for the path planning, automatic follow-up vehicle driving and lane departure warning.},
